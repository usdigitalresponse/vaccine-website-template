Vaccine Template Website

Contributors: rchandra1029

Description
If youâ€™re a public health or country official in the United States, you can use this template to get a head start on building your vaccine website. The template will provide you with (1) a pre-built home page with vaccine-related links and icons, (2) pre-loaded web pages on scheduling, timeline, impact, FAQs, and more. The template is a great way to provide access to vaccine information/actions, and is fast, mobile-friendly and accessible.
